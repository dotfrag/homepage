Hello, friend! I'm dotfrag, a Linux enthusiast currently working as a DevOps
engineer.

I created this site to write about the things I'm learning and want to remember
in the future. It is a hybrid between a blog and a personal knowledge base.

The main focus is on short and concise technical information. While this site
does not contain any rocket-science information, basic knowledge is assumed.

Technologies used:

- [Astro](https://astro.build/) (Static-Site Generator)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) (CSS Styling)
- [Catppuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin/tailwindcss) (CSS Color Theme)
- [Pagefind](https://pagefind.app/) (Static Search Library)
- [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/) (Hosting)
